Code snippets for data science (mostly) in Python, R, and other languages that I've compiled over the years. Contains utilities to convert/transfer snippets to Sublime Text 3 and R Studio.

Pull to local machine, fill in path variables in `config.env`, and copy/add/sync snippets as needed during your work.
